  <p>I think it is funny how many times this Left-Brain/Right-Brain discussion comes up in all the technical course that I have been taking for my degree. After researching the difference many of times before this I still think that I am most definitely a Right-brained person. I think this because if you look up what the right part of your brain handles I seems to use a lot of the things that it is capable of. I tend to be very creative when it comes to my work in and outside of school as well as having a lot of Non-Verbal communication meaning that I lick to communicate through pictures rather than words. I have included an image below that I like to use to demonstrate the Left vs the Right Brain curtesy of ucmas.ca.</p>
